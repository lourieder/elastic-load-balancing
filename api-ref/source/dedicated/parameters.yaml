  description: |

l7policy-listener_id:
  description: |
    Specifies the ID of the listener to which the forwarding policy is added.
    If action is set to REDIRECT_TO_POOL, the forwarding policy can be added to an HTTP or HTTPS listener.
    If action is set to REDIRECT_TO_LISTENER, the forwarding policy can be added to an HTTP listener.

    This parameter is unsupported. Please do not use it.

    Minimum: 1
    Maximum: 100
  in: body
  required: false
  type: int
l7policy-priority:
  description: |
    Specifies the forwarding policy priority. This parameter is available only for dedicated load balancers and will take effect when enhance_l7policy_enable is set to true. If this parameter is passed and enhance_l7policy_enable is set to false, an error will be returned. For shared load balancers, this parameter is not supported. If it is passed, an error will be returned.
    A smaller value indicates a higher priority. The value must be unique for each forwarding policy of the same listener.
    If action is set to REDIRECT_TO_LISTENER, the value can only be 0, indicating that REDIRECT_TO_LISTENER has the highest priority.

    - If enhance_l7policy_enable is set to false, forwarding policies are automatically prioritized based on the original sorting logic. Forwarding policy priorities are independent of each other regardless of domain names. If forwarding policies use the same domain name, their priorities follow the order of exact match (EQUAL_TO), prefix match (STARTS_WITH), and regular expression match (REGEX). If prefix match is used for matching, the longer the path, the higher the priority. If a forwarding policy contains only a domain name without a path specified, the path is /, and prefix match is used by default.

    - If enhance_l7policy_enable is set to true and this parameter is not passed, the priority will set to a sum of 1 and the highest priority of existing forwarding policy in the same listener by default. There will be two cases: a) If the highest priority of existing forwarding policies is the maximum (10,000), the forwarding policy will fail to create because the final priority for creating the forwarding policy is the sum of 1 and 10,000, which exceeds the maximum. In this case, please specify a value or adjust the priorities of existing forwarding policies. b) If no forwarding policies exist, the highest priority of existing forwarding policies will set to 1 by default.

    This parameter is unsupported. Please do not use it.
